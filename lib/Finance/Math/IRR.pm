=head1 NAME

Finance::Math::IRR - Calculate the internal rate of return of a cash flow

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Finance::Math::IRR;

    # we provide a cash flow
    my %cashflow = (
	'2001-01-01' => 100,
	'2001-03-15' => 250.45,
	'2001-03-20' => -50,
	'2001-06-23' => -763.12,  # the last transaction should always be <= 0
    );

    # and get the internal rate of return for this cashflow
    # we want a precision of 0.1%
    my $irr = xirr(%cashflow, precision => 0.001);

    # or simply: my $irr = xirr(%cashflow);

    if (!defined $irr) {
	die "ERROR: xirr() failed to calculate the IRR of this cashflow\n";
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The internal rate of return (IRR) is a powerfull tool when
evaluating the behaviour of a cashflow. It is typically used
to assess whether an investment will yield profit. But since
you are reading those lines, I assume you already know what
an IRR is about.

In this module, the internal rate of return is calculated in a similar way
as in the function XIRR present in both Excell and Gnumeric. This
means that cash flows where transactions come at irregular intervals
are well supported, and the rate is a yearly rate.

An IRR is obtained by finding the root of a polynomial where each coefficient is
the amount of one transaction in the cash flow, and the power of the
corresponding coefficient is the number of days between that transaction
and the first transaction divided by 365 (one year). Note that it isn't
a polynomial in the traditional meaning since its powers may have decimals or
be less than 1.

There is no universal way to solve this equation analytically. Instead,
we have to find the polynomial's root with various root finding algorithms.
That's where the fun starts...

The approach of Finance::Math::IRR is to try to approximate one of the polynomial's
roots with the secant method. If it fails, Brent's method is tried. However, Brent's
method requires to know of an interval such that the polynomial is positive on one
end of the interval and negative on the other. Finance::Math::IRR searches for such
an interval by trying systematically a sequence of points. But it may fail to find
such an interval and therefore fail to approximate the cashflow's IRR:


=head1 API

=over 4

=item xirr(%cashflow, precision => $float)

Calculates an approximation of the internal rate of return (IRR) of
the provided cashflow. The returned IRR will be within I<$float>
of the exact IRR. The cashflow is a hash with the following structure:

    my %cashflow = (
	# date => transaction_amount
	'2006-01-01' => 15,
	'2006-01-15' => -5,
	'2006-03-15' => -8,
    );

To get the IRR in percent, multiply xirr's result by 100.

If I<precision> is omitted, it defaults to 0.001, yielding 0.1%
precision on the resulting IRR.

I<xirr> may fail to find the IRR, in which case it returns undef.

I<xirr> will croak if you feed it with junk.

I<xirr> removes all transactions with amount 0 from the cashflow.
If the resulting cashflow is empty, an irr of 0% is returned.
If the resulting cashflow contains only one non 0 transaction,
undef is returned.

=head1 DISCUSSION

Finding the right strategy to solve the IRR equation is tricky.
Finance::Math::IRR uses a slightly different technique than the
corresponding XIRR function in Gnumeric.

Gnumeric uses first Newton's method to approximate the IRR. If
it fails, it evaluates the polynomial on a sequence of points
( '-1 + 10/(i+9)' and 'i' with i from 1 to 1024), hoping to find
2 points where the polynomial
is respectively positive and negative. If it finds 2 such points,
gnumeric's XIRR then uses the bisection method on their interval.

Finance::Math::IRR has a slightly different strategy. It uses the
secant method instead of Newton's, and Brent's method instead of
the bisection. Both methods are believed to be superior to their
Gnumeric counterparts. Finance::Math::IRR performs additional
controls to guaranty the validity of the result, such as controlling
that the root candidate returned by Secant and Brent really are roots.

    local $Finance::Math::IRR::DEBUG = 1;

=head1 BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

This module has been used in recquiring production
environments and thoroughly tested. It is therefore
believed to be robust.

Yet, the method used in xirr may fail to find the IRR even
on cashflows that do have an IRR. If you happen to find
such an example, please email it to the author at

=head1 THANKS

Kind thanks to Gautam Satpathy (C<< gautam@satpathy.in >>) who provided me with his port of
Gnumeric's XIRR to Java. Its source can be found at http://www.satpathy.in/jxirr/index.html.

Thanks to the team of Gnumeric for releasing their implementation of XIRR
in open source. For the curious, the code for XIRR is available in
the sources of Gnumeric in the file 'plugins/fn-financial/functions.c' (as
of Gnumeric 1.6.3).

More thanks to Nicholas Caratzas for his efficient help in improving this code!
